# React JS Exercises

These exercises will help you apply the basic concepts of React through tiny projects. Once you finish all exercises, you'll know you've got the basics down. Then you can start learning more advanced concepts, and build more complicated projects.

So let's get started!

## Exercise 1: Hello World!

Every programming language starter tutorial teaches you how to output "Hello, World!" using the language.

But this exercise is not just for tradition.

This will asses if you actually know HTML, which is one of the many prerequisites before learning React. Start by rendering a square with a background color. Inside the square, render "Hello, World!".

## Exercise 2: Capturing User Clicks

What makes a web app different from a static website? A web app is interactive. Of course, there's more to web apps than capturing clicks, but it's important to start from the basics.

This exercise gets you started with event handling, which is a basic concept not only in React but also in JavaScript (which is again another pre-requisite before learn React).

Using the native HTML <button> tag, capture the click event and alert the message, "Clicked!".

Take note that capturing events such as clicks is done differently in React than it is in JavaScript.
